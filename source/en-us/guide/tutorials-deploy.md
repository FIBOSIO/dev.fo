In the previous article, we have finished the js contract code and ABI file, and initiated the local test node. 
Now, we will deploy the contract to the environment and test the contract.


## Create an account

Create `config.js` under the root directory and save the following code for configuring the basic information.

```javascript
const config = {
    client: {
        chainId: 'cf057bbfb72640471fd910bcb67639c22df9f92470936cddc1ade0e2f2e7dc4f',
        httpEndpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:8888',
        keyProvider: 'your keyProvider'
    },
    contract: {
        name: 'todo',
        sender: 'todo'
    },
    testContract:{
        name: 'testtodo',
        sender: 'testtodo'
    },
    account: {
        publicKey: 'your public key',
        privateKey: 'your private key'
    }
}

module.exports = config
```

The release of contract needs to be performed via a fibos account, so initially, we need to create a fibos account and call the method of `newaccountSync()` to create the contract account.

Create a new folder named `scripts`Ôºåand save the code to `scripts/deploy.js`:

```js
const FIBOS = require('fibos.js');
const config = require('../config');
const fibosClient = FIBOS(config.client);
const fs = require('fs');

fibosClient.newaccountSync({
    creator: 'eosio',
    name: 'todo',
    owner: config.account.publicKey,
    active: config.account.publicKey,
});
```



## Compress JS contract
We read the js contract file through the fs module and package the contract with the `compileCode()` method.

Save the following code to `scripts/deploy.js` Ôºö

```js
const jsCode = fs.readTextFile(`${__dirname}/../contracts/todo.js`);
const wasm = fibosClient.compileCode(jsCode);
```

## Upload JS contract
Call the `setcodeSync()` method to upload the compressed content to the node.

Save the following code to `scripts/deploy.js` Ôºö

```js
fibosClient.setcodeSync(config.contract.name, 0, 0, zipCode);
```

## Get JS contract 

Use `getCodeSync()` method to read js filesÔºåand it is suggested to compare the js files with the provided js contracts from projects and see whether the two are consistent with each other.

Save the following code to `scripts/deploy.js` Ôºö

```js
const code = fibosClient.getCodeSync(config.contract.name, true);
console.log(code);
```

## Upload ABI file

Obtain the ABI file using the fs module and deploy the ABI file to the node via  
`setabiSync()` 

Save the following code to `scripts/deploy.js` Ôºö

```js
const abi = JSON.parse(fs.readTextFile(`${__dirname}/../contracts/todo.abi`));
fibosClient.setabiSync(config.contract.name, abi);
```


## Deploy contracts

We need to deploy the compiled wasm and ABI files to the node.


Run command 

```javascript
fibos-todomvc$ fibos  scripts/deploy.js
```

> Note: A new window is required to ensure that the node.js is working properly. If an account already exist error is reported, it is suggested to close the node and restart `fibos  start_fibos/node.js`.

Output (partial):

```
code: {
  "account_name": "todo",
  "code_hash": "383a12daacaf124eea9afc529822d990853b5b99570401b8394534b746ea3977",
  "wast": "",
  "wasm": "504b03042d00000008002cadfe4c6a9400a2360000003900000008001400696e6465782e6a7301001000000000000000000000000000000000004bad28c82f2a29d6cbc854b055282d4e2d52b0b55348cecf2bcecf49d54b2d2aca2fd250cfcc0389941425269758a9eb8055695a0300504b010200001400000008002cadfe4c6a9400a23600000039000000080000000000000001000000000000000000696e6465782e6a73504b0506000000000100010036000000700000000000"
}

```

So far, the contract has been successfully deployed to the node!
