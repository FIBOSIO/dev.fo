## FIBOS Introduction

- FIBOS is a platform for JavaScript runtime environment combining FIBJS and EOS, providing better programmability of EOS and creation of smart contracts using JavaScript.

- By providing a platform with JavaScript development, Bancor Protocol SmartTokens and developer services, FIBOS allows for rapid development, rapid deployment and stable token circulation of blockchain applications, helping developers step into the blockchain era. 


## Why creat FIBOS?

### 1. Currently, deployment environment of EOS is difficult 

The compilation environment of EOS is highly dependent, and there are always many challenges when compiling. Most normal developers are also at a loss when facing `CMake`. 

Under these circumstances, FIBOS provides a precompilation development environment so that developers can quickly finish deployment and spend more time writing smart contracts.


### 2. High development entry barrier

Writing EOS smart contracts requires the mastering of the C++ language, which is very costly for a developer, and we believe that it is just the initial step to correctly write the `CMAKELISTS.TXT` of compiled contracts! 

In terms of FIBOS, developers can write smart contracts using the JavaScript scripting language, which is much less costly. 

For a developer, we think they will be more likely to accept a simpler thing and will be eager to learn about FIBOS.


### 3. Outdated testing suite 

In terms of EOS, test cases must also be written in C++. Challenging language to learn and sophisticated compilation make such testing complex and difficult on EOS.

FIBOS integrates FIBJS server development platform, equipped with mature testing suite. The developers can write test cases using JavaScript on the FIBOS platform, making everything very flexible and easy!


### 4. Long iteration cycle of EOS

For successful deployment and release of an EOS smart contract, there are necessary writing, compilation, deployment, testing, debugging, and repair processes, which are very time-consuming.

FIBOS supports local contract mode, and both modification and testing can be performed at any time. Combined with some IDE tools, one-click development and testing can be accomplished.


### 5. Primitive development ecosystem 

EOS uses C++  in the development of R&D, and fails to realize an ecosystem like NPM. However, FIBOS supports NPM package management and is closely connected to the huge NPM ecosystem.


### 6. High costs for deployment and release of contracts

In terms of writing contract on EOS, the C++ code is required to be compiled into WASM, and the large compiled WASM file will bring high costs in release, deployment and operation of the contract. 

The script of contracts written on FIBOS can be packaged, greatly reducing the cost of deployment and release of contracts.


### 7. Non-auditable contracts

After the EOS contract is compiled into WASM file, there will be great challenges to auditing and reading of the contract code, causing developers failing in assessing the security of the contract.

On the other hand, FIBOS contracts are written in JavaScript and FIBOS will be all open source, facilitating community audits and quickly reaching consensus.
